<h1>👋 Hi, I'm Lyosha.</h1>
    <div class="bio">
        <p>I'm a product manager and producer in video game space. Apart from work, I'm a long-time F1 fan, love walking with my dog, nostalgic for pre-social media internet.</p>

        <p>Right now, I bring indie PC games to market @ <a href="https://herocraft.com/">Herocraft</a>. Before, I was leading product development at a video games discovery startup, and video games media with several million monthly visitors.</p>

        <p>You can reach me at: hey [at] lyosha.net.</p>

        <p>🦊 Trudi likes snow, meeting new people, playing with pine cones, traveling in a car, sleeping in parents' bed, yogurts. Dislikes fireworks, doctors, swimming, when her parents play too much with other dogs, rain, vacuum cleaners.</p>

    <div class="now">
        <h2>What I'm up to right now</h2>
        <p>I self-host super important family entertainment: Plex and Wordle. I also use a Raspberry Pi to run a couple of services using Docker. </p>
        <p>In 2025 I enjoyed watching Wake Up Dead Man, One Battle After Another, Nouvelle Vague and Sinners, playing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2721890/oo/">Öoo</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2525310/Drop_Duchy/">Drop Duchy</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2367820/despelote/">despelote</a>.</p>
        <p>Occasionally run around with my phone identifying birds via songs they make. Solving Rubik’s Cube in approximately 4 minutes 🐌.</p>

    <div class="tools">
        <h2>Tools I use</h2>
        <p>I use a MacBook Air M4 (boring). Most of the time it's connected to a 4K Dell U2725QE monitor. Plus, a desktop PC, built in a <a href="{{ .Site.BaseURL }}posts/2021-08-12-building-a-pc/">Streacom DA2</a> Mini-ITX (fun) case. Loved building it! It’s running the latest version of <a href="https://www.fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a>.</p>
        <p>Software: Sublime Text, Obsidian, NetNewsWire, Instapaper, Bitwarden, Syncthing, Terminal.</p>
