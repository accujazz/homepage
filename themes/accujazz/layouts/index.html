<h1>👋 Hi, I'm Alexey.</h1>
    <div class="bio">
        <p>I'm a product manager and producer in video game space. Apart from work, I'm a long-time F1 fan, love walking with my dog, nostalgic for pre-social media internet.</p>

        <p>Right now, I bring indie PC games to market @ <a href="https://herocraft.com/">Herocraft</a>. Before, I was leading product development at a video games discovery startup, and video games media with several million monthly visitors.</p>

        <h2>What I'm up to right now</h2>
        <p>I self-host super important family entertainment: Jellyfin and Wordle. Enjoyed watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien:_Earth">Alien: Earth</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinners_(2025_film)">Sinners</a>, playing <a href="https://www.animalwell.net/">Animal Well</a>. Occasionally run around with my phone identifying birds via songs they make. Solving Rubik’s Cube in approximately 4 minutes 🐌. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="tools">
        <h2>Tools I use</h2>
        <p>I've been a Mac user since the early 90s. Mac SE/30 was our first home computer, replaced by LC II and PowerMac 6100. Going into the university years, I switched to PC, mainly for games and software compatibility, returning to the Mac around 2010.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, I use a MacBook Air M1 (boring). Plus, a desktop PC, built in a <a href="{{ .Site.BaseURL }}posts/2021-08-12-building-a-pc/">Streacom DA2</a> Mini-ITX (fun) case. Loved building it! It’s running the latest version of <a href="https://www.fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a>.</p>
        <p>Software: Sublime Text, Obsidian, NetNewsWire, Instapaper, Bitwarden, Syncthing.</p>
