### Playing
Didn't have time to play all the interesting demos from the latest Steam Next Fest (who has?), but appreciated excellent narrative work in [Wanderstop](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1299460/Wanderstop/) demo, sort of a mini Forza Horizon structure in [Wheel World](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1497460/Wheel_World/) and a mix of Kurosawa film and Japan horror movie vibe in [Labyrinth Of The Demon King](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1804010/Labyrinth_Of_The_Demon_King/). Playing [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) and [Chess](https://deepgreen.app/) on the phone.

### Rubik's Cube
The first solution of Rubikâ€™s Cube I completed in approximately 4 hours. After a couple of days I could solve the cube in 15 minutes. Now in 4 minutes. Way harder to improve going forward!

### Software
Mostly noticing how the quality of Mac OS software is degrading. It's very sad. I can't switch to any other OS for full time work yet, though, feel the day is getting closer, and it's almost there.

### Devices
Thinking of upgrading to MacBook Air M4, given that now it comes with 16Gb of RAM and $100 cheaper for the base config. But what I'm really enthusiastic about is the latest Framework announcements: an affordable and small [Framework 12](https://frame.work/laptop12) laptop and powerful mITX [Framework Desktop](https://frame.work/desktop). These devices are democratic and beautiful!

### TV
[Adolescence](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31806037/) is important. In 2025 it's no secret what social media is doing to our brains, nonetheless we just live with it. Adolescence is a reminder that we shouldn't.
