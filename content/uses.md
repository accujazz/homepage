I had been a Mac user in the early 90s. Mac SE/30 was our first home computer, replaced by LC II and PowerMac 6100. Going into the university years, I switched to PC, mainly for games and software compatibility, returning to the Mac around 2010.

Nowadays, I use a MacBook Air M1 (16/256). When on desk, it's connected to a Gigabyte M28U 28" display. I also have a desktop PC, built in a [Streacom DA2](https://streacom.com/products/da2-mini-itx-case/) Mini-ITX case with AMD Ryzen 5 5600, Radeon 6600 and 32Gb of RAM. It's running the latest version of Ubuntu, which in many cases I like more than the latest versions of macOS.

On the go, I use an iPhone. I tend to dislike current mobile phones: they are overpriced, big, heavy, made of glass and their backs are full of cameras. I'd like to have a more simple utilitarian option - a quality tool, not a shiny fashion object.

I mostly use the defaults and stock software whenever I can, other than that:
