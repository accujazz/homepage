ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Alexey. I'm a product manager and producer in video game space. Apart from work, I'm a long-time F1 fan, love walking with my dog, nostalgic for pre-social media internet, and try to be mindful with my hardware/software choices.

---

Right now, I bring indie PC games to the market @ [Herocraft](https://herocraft.com/). Before, I was leading product development at a video games discovery startup, and video games media with several million monthly visitors.

You can reach me at: hey [at] lyosha.net.
