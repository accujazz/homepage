__[How Much Do I Really Need to Know?](https://www.wordsfromeliza.com/p/how-much-do-i-really-need-to-know) by Eeliza Mclamb__
>But I have recognized an impulse in myself to keep intaking information, as though it were a moral imperative to know every meticulous detail of all Earthly horrors. And, as much as I would like to think that it does, I don’t think that this impulse comes from duty. I think it comes from guilt. If I couldn’t directly help, the least I could do was witness. The least I could do was watch, feeling increasingly helpless, feeling increasingly numb.

How much do we have to follow the events that make us genuinely depressed and that we have no influence on? Very apt.

__[AI Slop Is a Brute Force Attack on the Algorithms That Control Reality](https://www.404media.co/ai-slop-is-a-brute-force-attack-on-the-algorithms-that-control-reality/) by 404 Media__  
We're in a period when it's very cheap to create trash content. Plus, it's cheap to distribute it. All companies that could influence that dynamic and keep public online spaces safe and clean, they just gave up, and moreover, are taking advantage of the situation to monetize engagement. They poison the environment we spend so much time in.

__["The Autumn, She’s Been Hit!" The wish that changed Halo forever](https://www.20k.org/episodes/the-autumn-shes-been-hit) by Twenty Thousand Hertz__  
I loved this episode so much. It's special and touches so many emotional things: youth friendship, bonding hobby, the immersive power of early video game experience..., and loss.

__[Nolen Royalty, known as eieio, keeps the internet fun with experimental multiplayer games](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/internet-culture/eieio-games-nolen-royalty/) by Kristina Bravo__
> Sometimes when I make a game people tell me that it reminds them of “the old internet.” When they say this I think that they basically mean that I’ve made something fun and unmonetized largely for the joy of…making something fun.

__[I regret not calling myself working class](https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/regret-not-calling-myself-working-class-3609677) by Natasha Devon__
>Still, I avoided describing myself as [working class](https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/been-working-class-middle-real-difference-3298188?srsltid=AfmBOop6BhGq9-lZD9939Qy_IUn7_BiUHILNBcdDUa30kG1tB_vcLcCD&ico=in-line_link) for two reasons. Firstly, I knew there were people who’d had it tougher than me.  
>…  
>But we’re through the looking glass now, living in an Orwellian hellscape where right-wing politicians from backgrounds involving wealth most of us can only dream of are claiming to be representatives of the working class.

__[New Elon Musk crime dropped](https://www.garbageday.email/p/new-elon-musk-crime-dropped) by Garbage Day__
>If AI gets as good as its biggest proponents think it’s destined to be, why would anyone build anything? Why would you build an app with AI? Why not just ask the AI to do that specific task for you? Something Amazon actually just [launched](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.ZE3yp4K2Y6WBUz6JXxBv2wFm0UMYg684pHxSI3sXM03tZjMyRikMbB6-pz0_hNvd6jEhUVroutPIP_GiYxUgXmc1Vn8P0wnoD90b2kt3ijIWN2kUFCB_PJS0IY5if2n63T8eVM3ta5_LRz5iXl1rYBnBrIbU1JOfAvd_CHjJ9jqvJSFjJ-VRl74Y_I_9o5OHSj2kCsVVTQSh-ABX-6aE4lZwOG0-kzNLTDYR9DaaTMeAUhPpR-uVHmBFK_Q5XDlBzNXEmqRBCh16g5aW8Rb7fv4cnhf9DtFAoc4qnG_zAxcGRp7oStg7qjHF0I41qu9tzk4NjhRxlxOfMmXEmfI2mg/4f9/eyfXVhaIS_GB6QlmpfWUdQ/h23/h001.Xvft6AXs_eef0rSUGxTr9DbbQDns1t6lM22u5dX7TOU) this morning. Similarly, with entertainment, why would studios need to exist if you could “make a movie with just a prompt,” as you’re bound to see someone fantasizing about on X. Even if studios just become holding pens for intellectual property, eventually that IP becomes worthless from overuse. Or, to take it back to memes, if AI tools make internet content indecipherable from spam, at a certain point, why would anyone bother. If the AI gets good enough it devours it will devour its container. Whether it’s an app, a studio, or even a social platform.
